        "### Purpose\n",
        "This notebook serves as an introduction to working with audio data for classification problems; it is meant as a learning resource rather than a demonstration of the state-of-the-art. The techniques mentioned in this notebook apply not only to classification problems, but to regression problems and problems dealing with other types of input data as well. I focus particularly on feature engineering techniques for audio data and provide an in-depth look at the logic, concepts, and properties of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model, an ancestor and the origin of deep neural networks (DNNs) today. I also provide an introduction to a few key machine learning models and the logic in choosing their hyperparameters. These objectives are framed by the task of recognizing emotion from snippets of speech audio.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Data cleansing and feature engineering comprise the most crucial aspect of preparing machine and deep learning models alike and is often the difference between success and failure. We can drastically improve the performance of a model with proper attention paid to feature engineering. This stands for input data which is already useable for predictions; even such data can be transformed in myriad ways to improve predictive performance. For features to be useful in classification they must encompass sufficient variance between different classes. We can further improve the performance of our models by understanding the influence of and precisely tuning their hyperparameters, for which there are algorithmic aids such as Grid Search.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network architecture is a critical factor in determining the computational complexity of DNNs; often, however, simpler models with just one hidden layer perform better than more complicated models. The importance of proper model evaluation cannot be overstressed: training data should be used strictly for training a model, validation data strictly for tuning a model, and test data strictly to evaluate a model once it is tuned - a model should never be tuned to perform better on test data. To this end, K-Fold Cross Validation is a staple tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusions\n",
        "Classic machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), k Nearest Neighbours (kNN), and Random Forests have distinct advantages to deep neural networks in many tasks but do not match the performance of even the simplest deep neural network in the task of audio classification. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is the simplest form of DNN suited to classification tasks, provides decent off-the-shelf performance, and can be precisely tuned to be accurate and relatively quick to train.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MLP provides appreciable accuracy on the RAVDESS dataset, but suffers from the relatively small number of training samples afforded by this dataset. Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are excellent DNN candidates for audio data classification: LSTM RNNs because of their excellent ability to interpret sequential data such as the audio waveform represented as a time series, and CNNs because features engineered on audio data such as spectrograms have marked resemblance to images, in which CNNs excel at recognition and discrimination between distinct patterns.\n",

        "In this notebook we explore the most common machine learning models, specifically those available off the shelf in scikit-learn. After benchmarking performance with machine learning models, we train a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for classification in an attempt to recognize the emotion conveyed in a speech audio snippet. MLP classifiers are a good DNN model to start with because they are simple, flexible, and suited when inputs are assigned a label - in our case, emotion.\n",

Each type of model (SVC, MLP, Random Forests, etc...) come with their own set of hyperparameters, and each type of optimization algorithm does as well.

In practice, **higher alpha more steeply penalizes large weights.**\n",

The number of neurons in that hidden layer is a less obvious choice, but it seems from literature that a number between the input layer and output layer size is a good starting point. At any rate, the time complexity of training our model scales exponentially with the number of hidden layers, so let's keep that number at the minimum, and likely optimum of 1.\n",

        "We initialize the MLP classifier with the hyperparameters we will keep constant, those less likely to have a significant impact on the model's performance. We shouldn't use grid search to look for hyperparameters we can easily tune later, such as the number of training iterations (# of forward+backward passes through the network for each _batch_ of training samples); if we do so, we significantly inflate the computational cost with little return. For these hyperparameters we should choose values which are usually reasonable from a literature search (...from stackexchange).\n",

        "We also define a **batch size**: the number of training samples included in one forward (input) and backward (error) pass of the model, which is one **iteration**. A batch size in range [1, #samples] is common - in our case, [1,1440\\*0.8]. [**Mini-batches**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-mini-batch-gradient-descent-configure-batch-size/) in the set [32, 64, 128, 256] are usually encouraged, especially on smaller datasets. **Smaller batches** cause more frequent weight updates and faster convergence - faster learning - though each update is less accurate compared to a larger batch. **Larger batches** train on a larger set of inputs simultaneously, and so may optimize loss better at each iteration due to a more accurate gradient computation - however, large batches may encourage overfitting and worsen generalization error."

        "Grid search chose the (Rectified Linear Unit) relu function as the best activation function The function returns 0 if it receives any negative input, but for any positive value  x, it returns that value back. So it can be written as  f(x)=max(0,x). While our **hidden layer use the relu function** for its activation on each neuron, our **output layer will necessarily use the softmax function** - an exponential normalization function - in order to scale output neuron values to a probability between \\[0,1\\] for each class (emotion). Softmax does this normalization by taking the exponent of the value of each output neuron and dividing that by sum of the exponentiated output values, producing _n_ probabilities for _n_ classes. We then choose the highest probability as the predicted class for a set of input features. To be clear, **softmax activation is applied to the values of _all_ output neurons _once_ - not to each neuron.**    \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Adam Optimization Algorithm\n",
        "The solver chosen is the **Adam optimization** algorithm, a variant of **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD). Unlike SGD, which maintains a constant learning rate throughout each training iteration, Adam actually 'adapts', or varies the learning rate by taking into account the moving averages of the first and second moments (mean and variance) of the gradient at each training iteration. It makes sense that grid search chose the more sophisticated algorithm - note however it's not necessarily better than SGD for all tasks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Architecture\n",
        "As expected, the ideal architechture involves just one hidden layer - though with double the neurons we expected for 180 features. Training the 2 and 3 hidden layer models was extremely computationally expensive compared to 1 hidden layer - and provided absolutely no benefit, only complexity and wasted resources. A good reinforcement of the power of simplicity, especially in deep neural networks. In the domain of model simplicity, there is also a compelling argument to be made for interpretability (to the point a model should _never_ be a black box) ...but that's for another time.\n",

The term cross-validation refers to validating the model on multiple validation sets.\n",
